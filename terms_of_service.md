## 1. The Basics

1.1. Density is a system that captures, analyzes, and distributes movement data. An internet connected, door-mounted sensor collects data (the “Density Sensor”). The data is analyzed and the resulting intelligence is distributed via an API (the “Density API”). In addition, there are many pieces of facilitating software, including but not limited to: provisioning applications, embedded systems, account management tools, algorithms, and the Density API (the “Density Software”). Collectively, the entire system is referred to herein as the “Service”.

1.2. Density Sensors are loaned to You at no cost. The Company retains full ownership, all Intellectual Property, and any and all other rights associated with the Density Sensors.

1.3. You pay a monthly/annual fee to access the Density API.

1.4. In the event You are no longer a customer, You must return the Density Sensors. Failure to return the sensors will result in a lost sensor fee.

## 2. Intellectual Property and Ownership

2.1. The Company retains all right, title, and ownership to the Service, including but not limited to: any and all intellectual property (i.e. patents, copyrights, etc.), trade secrets, and know how. This TOS, in no way, grants You any right of any kind (except as provided herein).

2.2. The Company provides You with Density Sensors on loan. The Company retains full ownership of any and all Density Sensors in your possession. The Company can recall them from You at any time for any reason.

## 4. Data Types, Ownership and Use

4.1. There are four types of data:

4.1.1. Raw Data: This is the initial data that a Density Sensor captures. Without analysis, it’s unintelligible.

4.1.2. Location Data: This data results from passing Raw Data through Density Software. With analysis, We can determine an object is a person and the direction it is moving. We can tell You how busy your location is in real time and make predictions about the future. Location Data is associated to a particular Density Sensor, location, and/or account.

4.1.3. Aggregated Data: This data results from synthesizing Location Data from many Density Sensors. Aggregated Data has no identifying information (location, account info, etc.).

4.1.4. Account Data: This is data that You provide when establishing/updating your account. It includes things like: name, email, phone number and billing details.
